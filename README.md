# randwrite

Randwrite replicates the writing style of a certain book, 
by determining the probability with which each character follows
every possible sequence of characters of length k. It reads from a 
given source file and redirects its results in an output file, named
in the command line.

The implementation of a doubly linked list data structure is also
provided, and used in randwrite
